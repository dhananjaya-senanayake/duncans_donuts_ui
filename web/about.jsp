Causing a media frenzy when we launched in late 2013, Duncan's Donu are now both a doughnut and food institution in the UK.

                            <p><br />
                                Duncan's Doughnuts are the world’s first artisan baked doughnut / croissant doughnut brand. Made with only natural ingredients and yet uncompromising on irresistible deliciousness, Duncan's offer beautifully baked (not fried) and handmade doughnuts to a growing legion of our loyal of fans across the UK.<br />
                                &nbsp;<br />
                                Our doughnuts include Glazed and Cake types - it is the daily top-seller in all of our outlets!<br />
                                &nbsp;<br />
                                We use the very best in cooking technology to control ingredients rather than the method of simply floating product in oil. Dum Dum Doughnuts are significantly lower in fat (half the fat in some instances) than our competitors thanks to our traditional patisserie-based baking process – so unique that it is patented in Europe and the US.<br />
                                &nbsp;<br />
                                Artisan doughnut chef Paul Hurley is the Founder of Duncan's Doughnuts and since 1997 he had the vision to create ‘The Best Doughnut In The World’. Although a grand statement, Paul, or ‘The Doughnut Guy’ as he has become known, believed this has to be at the heart of the brand. Our entire team of Donuttiers are pastry chefs or apprentices who have a real passion for good honest food. We are an independent British company that offers high quality, natural artisan doughnuts that are uniquely baked fresh every day – in fact, all of our outlets stay open every day until all doughnuts have sold out. It is exactly this concept which has proved such a hit with the British public.<br />
                                &nbsp;<br />
                                With successful East London based outlets in Box Park and Camden Market, we are now also the only doughnut brand in Harrods. We have also been chosen over the last couple of years to attend The Brit Awards, V Festival,&nbsp;JUST EAT'S First Food Fest and a varied range of events and locations.<br />
                                <br />
                                Duncan's also opening their first international outlet in Dubai at the beginning of 2106 with another nine UEA stores planned over the next five years. Currently wqe are in negotiation to expand to many other countries as well as increase our stores in the UK.<br />
                                <br />
                                We also have recently launched our new and highly sought after doughnut courier service, corporate design doughnut service and bespoke giant doughnut cake ordering option for our doughnut loving customers!<br />
                                <br />
                                Finally, chef Paul continues to push the boundaries of what can be created by launching in 2016, "The Crone" (A baked croissant dough Ice Cream cone) and the World's most expensive Cro - The Luxery Zebra at £1,500. &nbsp;More secret projects are on the way to ensure that our customers always have something delicious and creative to look forward to.&nbsp;<br />
                                &nbsp;<br />
                                In our relatively short lifespan, we have attracted an ever growing and loyal customer base from the public, press and celebrities alike. Our fast expanding company and unique offering has meant that we have been able to react to the growing demands of Duncan's fans across London. It’s worth noting that queues outside all Duncan's Donutteries are not uncommon!
